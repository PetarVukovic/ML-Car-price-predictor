# Car Price Prediction using PyTorch and Streamlit

This project is a Car Price Prediction application built using PyTorch for the machine learning model and Streamlit for the web interface. The application allows users to input car details such as mileage, age, and horsepower to predict the car's price.
The pytorch model is trained on car's training dataset (price,models,ages etc)
